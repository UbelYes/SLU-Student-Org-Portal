# SLU Student Organization Portal

A web portal for Saint Louis University's Office of Student Affairs (OSA) to manage student organizations, forms, and submissions.

## Prerequisites

- **WAMP Server** (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install WAMP Server
- Download and install [WAMP Server](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- Make sure WAMP is running (the icon should be green)

### 2. Set Up the Project
- Place this project folder in `c:\wamp64\www\`
- The path should look like: `c:\wamp64\www\[project-folder]\`

   - This will create the database `slu_org_db` with all required tables

### 4. Configure Database Connection (Optional)
- If you changed your MySQL credentials, edit `api\db.php`:
  ```php
  $DB_HOST = 'localhost';
  $DB_USER = 'root';        // Your MySQL username
